"""
Silver Transform for OpenWeather "current weather" events.

Purpose
-------
Promote immutable Bronze JSONL events into a clean, typed, de-duplicated
Silver dataset with explicit quality rules and strong provenance.

Scope
-----
- Input: Bronze objects written by `bronze_ingest.py`, one JSON object per line.
- Output: Partitioned Parquet (or warehouse table) containing one row per
  (city_id, event_ts_utc) with standardized columns and validation flags.

Primary Key
-----------
(city_id, event_ts_utc) per provider ("openweather").

Contract (Columns)
------------------
Keys & Provenance:
- event_id: str (24-hex, deterministic from provider natural key)
- city_id: int
- city_slug: str
- event_ts_utc: timestamp (tz-aware UTC)
- ingested_at_utc: timestamp (tz-aware UTC at promotion time)
- bronze_object_key: str (pointer to raw)
- checksum_sha256: str (integrity of raw JSONL object)
- source: str ("openweather")
- quality_flags: list[str] (or semicolon-joined string)
- conflict: bool (true if a competing record was dropped during dedup)

Core Measurements:
- temp_c, feels_like_c, temp_min_c, temp_max_c: float
- pressure_hpa: int
- humidity_pct: int
- wind_speed_ms, wind_gust_ms: float | null
- wind_deg: int | null
- clouds_pct: int | null
- visibility_m: int | null
- rain_1h_mm, snow_1h_mm: float | null
- weather_code: int | null
- weather_main, weather_desc: str | null

Geo & Time:
- lat: float
- lon: float
- timezone_offset_s: int | null
- date_utc: date  (derived from event_ts_utc)
- hour_utc: int   (0–23; optional partition)

Validation Rules
----------------
Critical (quarantine on failure):
- city_id not null
- event_ts_utc not null and >= 2000-01-01 UTC
- temp_c not null

Non-critical (nullify + flag on violation):
- temp_c ∈ [-80, 65]
- pressure_hpa ∈ [850, 1100]
- humidity_pct ∈ [0, 100]
- wind_speed_ms, wind_gust_ms ≥ 0
- clouds_pct ∈ [0, 100]
- lat ∈ [-90, 90], lon ∈ [-180, 180]
- visibility_m ≥ 0 (flag if > 20_000 as suspicious_high_visibility)
- rain_1h_mm, snow_1h_mm ≥ 0  (negative → quarantine)

Deduplication Policy
--------------------
Uniqueness on (city_id, event_ts_utc). Keep LAST writer (or FIRST—choose and
encode consistently). If conflicting payloads exist, set conflict=true on survivor.

Partitioning
------------
- Always: date_utc
- Optional: hour_utc (if frequent hour-level filters)
- Directory layout for Parquet:
  silver/weather_current/date_utc=YYYY-MM-DD[/hour_utc=HH]/city_slug=<slug>/*.parquet

Idempotency & Side Effects
--------------------------
- Promotion is deterministic for identical Bronze inputs.
- Writing is idempotent within a partition if the same rows are produced.
- Quarantine writes mirror Bronze partitioning and include reason + context.

Configuration
-------------
Relies on environment variables for buckets/regions. No secrets are logged.
"""



"""
List Bronze JSONL object keys for a given city and UTC date.

Args:
  city_slug (str): Canonical slug for the city (e.g., "london").
  date_utc (datetime.date): Target UTC calendar date to scan under Bronze.

Returns:
  list[str]: Fully qualified object keys (relative to the Bronze bucket)
             that end with ".jsonl" for the specified city/date. The list
             may be empty if no data is present.

Raises:
  RuntimeError: On storage access errors (list operation failure).

Notes:
  - This function performs discovery only (no reads); it may paginate under
    the hood.
  - If hour-level partitioning exists in Bronze, keys will span multiple
    hour subdirectories.
  - Caller decides whether to further filter by hour(s).
"""


"""
Read a Bronze JSONL object and return parsed payloads.

Args:
  object_key (str): Bronze object key previously discovered.

Returns:
  tuple[list[dict], str]:
    - payloads: List of dicts parsed from each non-empty line in the object.
    - checksum_sha256: Hex digest of the raw object bytes, used for provenance.

Raises:
  RuntimeError: If the object cannot be fetched or parsed.
  ValueError: If a line is not valid JSON.

Idempotency:
  - Pure read. Does not mutate storage.

Observability:
  - The returned checksum is used to verify integrity and assist dedup.
"""


def normalize(payload, *, city_slug, bronze_key, checksum_sha256):
 """
Map a raw OpenWeather payload into a Silver row (no validation yet).

Args:
  payload (dict): Single OpenWeather "current weather" JSON object.
  city_slug (str): Canonical city slug for partitioning.
  bronze_key (str): Source Bronze object key (provenance).
  checksum_sha256 (str): Hex digest of the Bronze object bytes.

Returns:
  dict | None: A single Silver-shaped row with all expected columns,
               including partitions and provenance. Returns None if the
               payload lacks natural key fields required to derive:
               - city_id (payload['id'])
               - event_ts_utc (from payload['dt'])
               In this case, caller should quarantine with reason
               "missing_natural_key".

Columns Populated:
  - event_id derived deterministically from (provider, city_id, dt)
  - city_id, city_slug, city_name (title-cased if present)
  - event_ts_utc (tz-aware UTC)
  - ingested_at_utc (current UTC now at normalization time)
  - bronze_object_key, checksum_sha256, source="openweather"
  - All core measurements & geo fields where present
  - date_utc, hour_utc derived from event_ts_utc
  - quality_flags initialized empty
  - conflict initialized False

Determinism:
  - Given identical payload, city_slug, bronze_key, checksum → identical row.

Side Effects:
  - None. Pure transformation.

"""
Apply Silver validation rules to a single normalized row.

Args:
  row (dict): A normalized Silver-shaped row (from `normalize`).

Returns:
  tuple[dict, list[str], str]:
    - fixed_row: The row after applying nullifications/caps for non-critical
                 violations (do not silently cap unless the contract allows it;
                 prefer NULL + flag).
    - flags: List of quality flags applied to the row (strings).
    - verdict: One of {"pass", "quarantine"} indicating promotion eligibility.

Validation Semantics:
  - Critical failures (e.g., missing event_ts_utc, temp_c, or nonsensical time)
    → verdict="quarantine".
  - Non-critical range violations → set offending field to NULL and append a
    descriptive flag (e.g., "humidity_out_of_range").
  - Negative accumulations (rain_1h_mm, snow_1h_mm) → quarantine.
  - Lat/Lon policy: either quarantine or null+flag, per contract decision.

Invariants:
  - Primary key fields (city_id, event_ts_utc) must be present on "pass".
  - date_utc and hour_utc must be consistent with event_ts_utc.

Side Effects:
  - None. Pure function.

Examples of Flags:
  - "humidity_out_of_range"
  - "visibility_suspicious_high"
  - "latlon_out_of_range"

"""
Persist an invalid or rejected record into a quarantine area for audit.

Args:
  reason (str): Short machine-friendly reason (e.g., "missing_natural_key",
                "negative_rain", "critical_null_temp").
  payload (dict | str): The raw payload or a serialized form that caused
                        rejection (do NOT include secrets).
  context (dict): Additional fields to aid triage:
                  {
                    "city_slug": str,
                    "date_utc": str (YYYY-MM-DD),

                    "rule": str (optional human-readable message)
                  }

Returns:
  None

Raises:
  RuntimeError: On storage write failures.

Write Layout:
  quarantine/silver/reason=<reason>/city=<slug>/date=YYYY-MM-DD/hour=HH/<id>.json

Notes:
  - Keep files small and structured; avoid PII and secrets.
  - Quarantine volume is a signal—consider alerting if rate exceeds threshold.
"""


"""
Enforce uniqueness on (city_id, event_ts_utc) and mark conflicts.

Args:
  rows (list[dict]): Validated rows with consistent primary keys.
  policy (str): Conflict resolution strategy:
                - "last": keep the lexicographically/latest row by a stable
                          tiebreaker (e.g., bronze_object_key or ingestion time).
                - "first": keep the earliest row by the same tiebreaker.

Returns:
  list[dict]: Deduplicated rows. For any PK with >1 candidates, the retained
              row has `conflict=True` if the dropped competitor(s) had any
              differing non-provenance fields; otherwise `conflict=False`.

Determinism:
  - Deterministic given the tiebreaker and input order normalization.

Side Effects:
  - None.

Notes:
  - Caller must define and document the tiebreaker used (e.g., bronze key or
    manifest timestamp) and keep it consistent across runs.

End-to-end orchestration for promoting Bronze → Silver for one city-date.

Args:
  city_slug (str): Canonical city slug (e.g., "london").

Raises:
  RuntimeError: On unrecoverable I/O or write failures.

Flow:
  1) Discover Bronze object keys for (city_slug, date_utc).
  2) For each key:
       - Read JSONL → payloads, compute checksum.
       - Normalize each payload to a row (or quarantine if missing keys).
       - Validate each row → pass or quarantine.
  3) Deduplicate passing rows by (city_id, event_ts_utc) using policy.
  4) Write Silver partitions; collect paths and counts.
  5) Compute and return the report (and optionally enforce a guardrail:
     fail if quarantine_rate > threshold).

Idempotency:
  - Safe to re-run for the same city/date; results should converge.

Guardrails:
  - Optionally raise if quarantine_rate exceeds configured threshold.
"""

"""
CLI entrypoint for manual or scheduled runs.

Behavior:
  - Parse environment or CLI args for `city_slug` and `target_date_utc`
    (default: today's UTC date).
  - Call `run(...)` and print a concise report.
  - Exit non-zero on guardrail violations or write failures.

Notes:
  - Keep orchestration in `run`; `main` should remain a thin wrapper.
